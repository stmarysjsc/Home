          The history of “St. Mary’s Jacobite Syrian Church, Naigaon – Vasai” is connected to the history of 
          “St. Thomas Syrian Church Congregation, Byculla, Mumbai” which was established in the year 1975. 
          As the number of Jacobite Syrian Christian families increased, many members came and settled in 
          Mira Road, Bhayandar, Naigaon, Vasai, Nallasopara and Virar. However, for Holy Qurbana and other 
          spiritual needs, they depended on Byculla and Malad parishes.

          A service center was setup and the first Holy Qurbana was conducted on 29th November,1987 
          by Rev. Fr. Varghese Valayil.  
          With growing members, Vasai was declared an independent center in 1998.  
          Later, with the efforts of parishioners, land of 65 cents was donated by Mr. Antony John Pereira.
